# Task 7: Monitoring Setup - Add logging, health checks, and status reporting

## Description

Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and health check systems for the claude-flow integration. This task focuses on creating robust observability infrastructure that provides real-time insights into system health, performance metrics, and operational status.

The monitoring system will include structured logging, health check endpoints, status dashboards, and circuit breakers for API rate limit management, ensuring reliable operation and quick issue identification.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Logging Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels
- [ ] Create centralized log aggregation and storage
- [ ] Add request/response logging for API calls
- [ ] Implement log rotation and retention policies
- [ ] Create searchable log indexing for troubleshooting

### Health Checks
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Create dependency health validation (MCP server connectivity)
- [ ] Add resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Implement service availability checks
- [ ] Create automated alerting for critical failures

### Status Dashboard
- [ ] Build real-time status dashboard for system overview
- [ ] Display service health and performance metrics
- [ ] Show active tasks and queue status
- [ ] Implement user-friendly status indicators
- [ ] Add historical performance tracking

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for API rate limits
- [ ] Add automatic fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Create rate limit monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Add manual circuit breaker controls

## Technical Details

### Logging Architecture
```python
# Structured logging configuration
import logging
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Log levels and formats
LOG_LEVELS = {
    'DEBUG': debugging information
    'INFO': general operational messages
    'WARNING': concerning but non-critical issues
    'ERROR': error conditions requiring attention
    'CRITICAL': severe errors requiring immediate action
}
```

### Health Check Endpoints
```python
# Health check implementation
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    return {
        'status': 'healthy',
        'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        'version': app.config['VERSION'],
        'dependencies': check_dependencies()
    }

@app.route('/health/deep')
def deep_health_check():
    # Comprehensive system validation
    return detailed_health_status()
```

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```python
# Circuit breaker for API rate limits
class APICircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        
    def call_api(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        # Circuit breaker logic with fallback
        pass
```

### Dashboard Components
1. **Service Status Overview**
   - Real-time health indicators
   - Service availability metrics
   - Recent error counts and trends

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time percentiles
   - Request volume and rate
   - Resource utilization graphs

3. **Task Management Status**
   - Active task count and queue depth
   - Task completion rates and failures
   - Processing time statistics

4. **System Resources**
   - CPU and memory usage
   - Network connectivity status
   - Storage utilization

## Dependencies

- **Task 6**: Claude Flow Service Implementation
  - Requires base service for health check integration
  - Needs API endpoints for monitoring
  - Depends on service architecture for instrumentation

- **Task 2**: Service Orchestrator Development
  - Requires orchestrator for centralized monitoring
  - Needs task management system for queue monitoring
  - Depends on service coordination for health checks

## Effort Estimate

**Size: S (8 hours)**

Breakdown:
- Logging infrastructure setup: 2 hours
- Health check implementation: 2 hours
- Status dashboard development: 2 hours
- Circuit breaker implementation: 1.5 hours
- Documentation and testing: 0.5 hours

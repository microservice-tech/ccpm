# Task 9: State Management - Implement JSON-based workflow state tracking

## Description

Implement a comprehensive JSON-based state management system for tracking all aspects of the claude-flow workflow execution. This system will maintain persistent state across service restarts and provide visibility into the current status of all active and completed workflows.

The state management system will track issues being processed, agent assignments, recovery scenarios, and execution queues. This enables the service to resume operations gracefully after restarts and provides debugging capabilities for workflow analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JSON state files created in `.claude/state/` directory
- [ ] Issue state tracking with status transitions
- [ ] Agent assignment and execution state management  
- [ ] Recovery state handling for failed workflows
- [ ] Queue state management for pending operations
- [ ] Thread-safe read/write operations for concurrent access
- [ ] State validation and corruption recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Atomic file operations to prevent partial state corruption
- [ ] State cleanup for completed/expired workflows

## Technical Details

### State Directory Structure
```
.claude/state/
├── issues/           # Individual issue state files
├── agents/           # Agent execution states
├── queue/            # Processing queue state
├── recovery/         # Recovery operation states
└── metadata/         # System metadata and configuration
```

### State Schema Design
- **Issue State**: Current status, assigned agents, timestamps, error counts
- **Agent State**: Active executions, resource allocations, performance metrics
- **Queue State**: Pending operations, priorities, dependencies
- **Recovery State**: Failed operations, retry attempts, recovery strategies

### Implementation Requirements
- JSON serialization with proper schema validation
- File locking mechanisms for concurrent access protection  
- Backup and restore capabilities for critical state data
- Configurable state retention policies
- Performance optimization for frequent read/write operations

## Dependencies

None - this task can start immediately and runs parallel to service foundation.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: S (8 hours)**

- State schema design: 2 hours
- JSON file operations implementation: 3 hours
- Concurrency and safety mechanisms: 2 hours
- Testing and validation: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All state types properly tracked and persisted
- [ ] Concurrent access handled safely without corruption
- [ ] State recovery works correctly after unexpected shutdowns
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable read/write speeds
- [ ] State validation prevents invalid data persistence
- [ ] Cleanup mechanisms remove stale state files
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] State files are human-readable and debuggable

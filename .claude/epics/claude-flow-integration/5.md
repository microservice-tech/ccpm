# Task 5: GitHub Integration - Extend PM scripts for autonomous PR creation

## Description

Extend the existing project management scripts to enable autonomous pull request creation and management. This integration will leverage the GitHub CLI (gh) for all GitHub operations, providing seamless integration with the Claude Flow system for automated code review, PR creation, and project management workflows.

The system will build upon the existing PM script foundation while adding sophisticated GitHub workflow automation capabilities that respect project conventions and maintain high code quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extended PM scripts with GitHub integration capabilities
- [ ] Autonomous PR creation with proper templates and metadata
- [ ] Branch management and cleanup automation
- [ ] Code review automation with quality gates
- [ ] Integration with existing CCPM workflow
- [ ] Proper error handling for GitHub API failures
- [ ] Support for draft PRs and ready-for-review transitions
- [ ] Automated PR descriptions with context and changes summary
- [ ] Unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] k6 performance tests for GitHub API interactions

## Technical Details

### Core Components

1. **GitHub Service Extension**
   - Extend existing PM scripts with GitHub capabilities
   - Implement gh CLI wrapper for consistent operations
   - Add GitHub API rate limiting and error handling
   - Support for multiple repository configurations

2. **PR Management System**
   - Automated PR creation from feature branches
   - Dynamic PR template population
   - Change detection and description generation
   - Review assignment and notification management

3. **Branch Workflow Automation**
   - Feature branch creation and naming conventions
   - Automated branch cleanup after merge
   - Conflict detection and resolution guidance
   - Sync with upstream branches

4. **Integration Points**
   - Connect with Claude Flow orchestrator
   - Interface with CCPM task management
   - Webhook support for GitHub events
   - Status reporting and metrics collection

```

### Key Features

- **Smart PR Creation**: Automatically generates comprehensive PR descriptions
- **Quality Gates**: Enforces code quality checks before PR creation
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing CCPM workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling for network and API failures
- **Template Management**: Dynamic PR and issue template handling

### GitHub CLI Integration

All GitHub operations will use the `gh` CLI tool for consistency and reliability:
- Repository operations (clone, fork, sync)
- Pull request management (create, update, merge)
- Issue tracking and project board updates
- Review management and notifications

## Dependencies

- **Task 6**: Service Foundation - Required for base service infrastructure and PM script foundation

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (M)
**Estimated Hours**: 12 hours

### Breakdown:
- PM script extension design: 2 hours
- GitHub service implementation: 4 hours
- PR management system: 3 hours
- Branch workflow automation: 2 hours
- Testing and integration: 1 hour

# Stream A: Core Service Implementation

## Scope
Main Python service with GitHub polling and workflow orchestration

## Files
- .claude/services/claude-flow-service.py
- .claude/services/issue_processor.py
- .claude/services/github_client.py
- .claude/services/workflow_executor.py

## Progress
- ✅ Created .claude/services directory structure in the worktree
- ✅ Implemented GitHub API client with authentication and rate limiting (github_client.py)
  - Full GitHub REST API integration with proper authentication
  - Rate limiting handling with automatic backoff
  - Repository info extraction from URLs
  - Issue management, commenting, and PR creation
- ✅ Created issue processor for managing concurrent issue processing (issue_processor.py)
  - Concurrent processing with process pools
  - Issue state management and persistence
  - Progress tracking and error handling
  - Automatic retry logic with configurable attempts
- ✅ Built workflow executor that calls the workflow-template.sh script (workflow_executor.py)
  - Subprocess management for workflow execution
  - Log streaming and monitoring
  - Process cancellation and cleanup
  - PR URL extraction from execution logs
- ✅ Implemented main Python service with GitHub polling and orchestration (claude_flow_service.py)
  - GitHub polling every 5 minutes (configurable)
  - Service lifecycle management with proper shutdown
  - Signal handling for graceful termination
  - PID file management for systemd integration
- ✅ Added proper logging, error handling, and signal management to all services
  - Comprehensive logging with configurable levels
  - Exception handling with meaningful error messages
  - Signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP
  - Resource cleanup on shutdown
- ✅ Support for configuration via environment variables and JSON file
  - Environment variable configuration loading
  - JSON configuration file support
  - Configuration validation
  - Example configuration provided
- ✅ Integration testing completed successfully
  - All service components tested
  - Workflow script integration verified
  - Import system working correctly
  - All tests passing

## Implementation Details

### Core Service Architecture
The service implements a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **GitHubClient**: Handles all GitHub API interactions with proper authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
2. **IssueProcessor**: Manages concurrent issue processing using process pools, tracks state, and handles retries
3. **WorkflowExecutor**: Executes the workflow-template.sh script with proper subprocess management and monitoring
4. **ClaudeFlowService**: Main orchestrator that polls GitHub and coordinates the entire workflow

### Key Features Implemented
- GitHub API polling with configurable intervals (default: 5 minutes)
- Concurrent processing of multiple issues with configurable worker limits
- Proper error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
- State persistence to avoid duplicate processing
- Comprehensive logging with configurable levels
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- PID file management for systemd integration
- Configuration via environment variables or JSON file
- Rate limiting compliance with GitHub API

- `/home/nic/Documents/development/epic-claude-flow-integration/.claude/services/test_integration.py` (integration tests)

### Integration with Existing Components
- Integrates seamlessly with workflow-template.sh script from Issue #18
- Proper subprocess management for script execution
- Log file management and PR URL extraction
- Environment variable passing to workflow scripts

### Testing Results
All integration tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Module imports working correctly
- ✅ Service configuration loading from environment variables
- ✅ Workflow executor dry-run execution successful
- ✅ GitHub API client initialization
- ✅ Issue processor state management

## Status: COMPLETED

The Core Service Implementation stream is fully completed with all required functionality implemented and tested. The service is ready for deployment and integration with systemd.

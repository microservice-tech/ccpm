# Stream B: Configuration & Service Management

## Scope
systemd integration, configuration management, and service utilities

## Files
- .claude/services/claude-flow.service
- .claude/services/config.json
- .claude/services/config_manager.py
- .claude/services/service_manager.py

## Progress
- ✅ Created .claude/services directory structure in worktree
- ✅ Implemented config_manager.py with comprehensive JSON and environment variable support
  - Supports dot notation configuration access (e.g., 'github.token')
  - Environment variable overrides with CLAUDE_FLOW_ prefix
  - Type coercion for boolean, integer, and float values
  - Configuration validation and error handling
  - Hierarchical configuration merging
- ✅ Created default config.json with all necessary settings
  - GitHub API configuration (token, repo, polling settings)
  - Service configuration (intervals, concurrency, workspace paths)
  - Claude Flow installation and execution settings
  - systemd and monitoring configuration
- ✅ Implemented service_manager.py for complete lifecycle management
  - Start/stop/restart/reload operations with timeout handling
  - Comprehensive status reporting including systemd, process, and health info
  - Resource usage monitoring with psutil integration
  - Health check integration via HTTP endpoint
  - Graceful and forced shutdown capabilities
  - Autostart enable/disable functionality
  - Status persistence to JSON file
- ✅ Created claude-flow.service systemd unit file
  - Proper network and service dependencies
  - Comprehensive security hardening (NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem, etc.)
  - Resource limits (2GB memory, 200% CPU quota)
  - Restart policies with exponential backoff
  - Log rotation via systemd/journald
  - Health monitoring with watchdog timer
  - Dedicated user/group for security isolation

## Integration Points
The service management components are designed to integrate with:
- claude-flow-service.py (main service implementation from Stream A)
- github_client.py, issue_processor.py, workflow_executor.py (Stream A components)
- Configuration loaded via ConfigManager in main service
- Status reporting and health checks available via ServiceManager
- systemd service unit ready for installation and activation

## Installation Notes
1. Install service files to /opt/claude-flow/
2. Create claude-flow user/group: `sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false claude-flow`
3. Copy systemd unit: `sudo cp claude-flow.service /etc/systemd/system/`
4. Create config directory: `sudo mkdir -p /etc/claude-flow /var/lib/claude-flow`
5. Copy and customize config.json to /etc/claude-flow/
6. Set proper ownership and permissions
7. Enable and start: `sudo systemctl enable --now claude-flow.service`

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All Stream B components implemented and ready for integration

# Task 11: Agent Personas - Generate specialized agents using existing persona system

## Description

Leverage the existing persona generation system to create six specialized microagent personas optimized for claude-flow workflow execution. These agents will handle different aspects of issue resolution including architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and documentation.

Each agent will be ultra-specialized with minimal context requirements and clear handoff protocols. The agents will work together in a coordinated workflow to transform GitHub issues into fully implemented, tested, and deployed solutions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow Architect agent persona generated and validated
- [ ] Backend Specialist agent persona created with API focus
- [ ] Frontend Specialist agent persona created with UI/UX focus  
- [ ] Testing Specialist agent persona for comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] DevOps Specialist agent persona for deployment and infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation Specialist agent persona for user-facing content
- [ ] All personas include clear handoff protocols
- [ ] Validation criteria defined for each agent's output
- [ ] Agent interaction patterns documented

## Technical Details

### Agent Specializations

**Workflow Architect**
- Decomposes GitHub issues into actionable tasks
- Designs implementation architecture
- Coordinates agent handoffs and dependencies

**Backend Specialist**  
- API design and implementation
- Database schema and operations
- Server-side business logic
- Performance optimization

**Frontend Specialist**
- User interface implementation
- Client-side functionality
- Responsive design patterns
- User experience optimization

**Testing Specialist**
- Unit test implementation (90%+ coverage requirement)
- Integration and performance testing
- Playwright test automation
- k6 performance testing

**DevOps Specialist**
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Infrastructure as code
- Deployment automation

**Documentation Specialist**
- API documentation generation
- User guides and tutorials
- Code documentation standards
- README and project documentation

### Implementation Approach
- Use existing `/create-persona` command for each agent type
- Leverage Workflow Architect and Persona Template Specialist
- Generate personas in `claude-config/agent-personas/generated/claude-flow/`
- Ensure compatibility with Task tool execution model

## Dependencies

None - this task leverages existing persona generation infrastructure and can run parallel to other foundation tasks.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (12 hours)**

- Persona generation for 6 agents: 6 hours
- Handoff protocol design: 2 hours
- Validation criteria definition: 2 hours
- Testing and refinement: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All six agent personas generated and saved
- [ ] Each persona includes complete system prompts
- [ ] Handoff protocols clearly define input/output formats
- [ ] Validation criteria enable automated quality checks
- [ ] Personas tested individually with sample tasks
- [ ] Agent interaction workflow documented
- [ ] Generated personas follow project coding standards
- [ ] All agents align with project requirements (MongoDB, Prisma, Docker, etc.)

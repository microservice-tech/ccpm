# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #6

## Overview
Create a Python-based systemd service that continuously polls GitHub for issues labeled "ready-for-implementation" and orchestrates the complete per-issue workflow using the workflow template from Issue #18. The service manages isolated workspace creation, Claude Flow installation, hive-mind execution, and PR automation.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Service Implementation
**Scope**: Main Python service with GitHub polling and workflow orchestration
**Files**:
- .claude/services/claude-flow-service.py
- .claude/services/issue_processor.py
- .claude/services/github_client.py
- .claude/services/workflow_executor.py
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 8
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Configuration & Service Management
**Scope**: systemd integration, configuration management, and service utilities
**Files**:
- .claude/services/claude-flow.service
- .claude/services/config.json
- .claude/services/config_manager.py
- .claude/services/service_manager.py
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Testing & Documentation
**Scope**: Unit tests, integration tests, and comprehensive documentation
**Files**:
- .claude/services/tests/test_service.py
- .claude/services/tests/test_github_client.py
- .claude/services/tests/test_workflow_executor.py
- .claude/services/README.md
- .claude/services/INSTALL.md
**Agent Type**: test-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A and B complete
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `.claude/services/__init__.py` - All streams (minimal, just exports)
- `.claude/services/constants.py` - Streams A & B (shared constants)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core service must be implemented before testing
2. Configuration schema must be defined before config manager
3. Service implementation before systemd integration testing

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on largely separate files
- Clear module boundaries between service core and configuration
- Testing stream depends on implementation completion

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A and B simultaneously as they handle different aspects of the service. Stream C (testing) starts after both implementation streams complete. This maximizes parallelization while ensuring tests have complete implementation to validate.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 12 hours (8h parallel + 4h testing)
- Total work: 16 hours
- Efficiency gain: 25%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 16 hours

## Notes
- Stream A should integrate with the workflow template from Issue #18
- Stream B must ensure proper systemd dependencies and restart policies
- Configuration should support both environment variables and JSON file
- Service must handle graceful shutdown and cleanup of running workflows
- Implement exponential backoff for GitHub API rate limiting
- Use Python's multiprocessing.Pool for concurrent issue processing
- Ensure proper signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for systemd compatibility
- Include health check endpoint or status file for monitoring
- Log rotation should be handled by systemd/journald

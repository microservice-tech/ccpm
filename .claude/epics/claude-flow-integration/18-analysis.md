# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #18

## Overview
Create a comprehensive workflow template that orchestrates the complete per-issue implementation lifecycle, including workspace isolation, repository operations, local Claude Flow installation, hive-mind execution, PR creation, and cleanup. This foundational component enables autonomous issue processing.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Workflow Template Implementation
**Scope**: Core workflow script and orchestration logic
**Files**:
- .claude/scripts/workflow-template.sh
- .claude/scripts/utils/workspace-manager.sh
- .claude/scripts/utils/git-operations.sh
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 12
**Dependencies**: none

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
None - this is a standalone implementation creating new files

### Sequential Requirements
This is a single-stream implementation as the workflow template must be cohesive and integrated. Breaking it into parallel streams would create unnecessary complexity and coordination overhead.

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Creating new files in dedicated script directories
- No modification of existing files required
- Clean namespace with no conflicts

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: sequential

This task is best implemented as a single cohesive unit because:
1. The workflow steps are tightly coupled and interdependent
2. Testing requires the complete workflow to be in place
3. Splitting would create artificial boundaries that complicate implementation
4. The 12-hour estimate is reasonable for a single focused effort

## Expected Timeline

With single-stream execution:
- Wall time: 12 hours
- Total work: 12 hours
- Efficiency: Optimal for this type of cohesive implementation

## Notes
- Focus on robustness and error handling throughout the workflow
- Ensure proper cleanup even on failure scenarios
- Include comprehensive logging for debugging
- Make the script modular for easy maintenance
- Consider edge cases like network failures and API limits
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Document all configuration requirements clearly

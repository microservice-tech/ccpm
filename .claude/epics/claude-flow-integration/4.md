# Task 4: Test Automation - Integrate Playwright MCP for test execution

## Description

Implement comprehensive test automation using Playwright MCP for UI testing and pytest for backend API tests. This task focuses on creating a robust testing framework that validates both the claude-flow service functionality and the UI components, ensuring reliable integration testing across all components.

The testing framework will leverage the Docker environment from Task 10 and provide automated validation of the claude-flow integration, including error handling, rate limiting, and user interface functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Playwright MCP Integration
- [ ] Install and configure Playwright MCP for UI testing
- [ ] Create test scenarios for claude-flow service interactions
- [ ] Implement tests for error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Set up automated browser testing across multiple browsers
- [ ] Create visual regression tests for UI components

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Set up pytest framework for API testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for claude-flow service endpoints
- [ ] Implement integration tests for MCP server communication
- [ ] Add tests for rate limiting and error scenarios
- [ ] Achieve minimum 90% code coverage as per project requirements

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure test execution in Docker containers
- [ ] Set up test data management and cleanup
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
- [ ] Implement test reporting and coverage metrics
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks using k6 as per project requirements

## Technical Details

### Playwright MCP Setup
```bash
# Install Playwright MCP
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install

# MCP integration configuration
playwright.config.js:
- Browser configurations (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test environment setup
- Screenshot and video recording
- Parallel execution settings
```

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Claude Flow Service Tests**
   - MCP server connection and communication
   - Task creation and execution
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Rate limiting behavior

2. **UI Integration Tests**
   - Task creation and monitoring interface
   - Real-time status updates
   - Error message display
   - User workflow validation

3. **Performance Tests**
   - API response times under load
   - Concurrent user scenarios
   - Memory and resource usage
   - Rate limit compliance

## Dependencies

- **Task 10**: Docker Development Environment
  - Requires containerized environment for test execution
  - Needs service orchestration for integration testing
  - Depends on environment configuration and networking

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (12 hours)**

Breakdown:
- Playwright MCP setup and configuration: 3 hours
- UI test implementation: 4 hours
- Backend API testing with pytest: 3 hours
- K6 performance testing setup: 1 hour
- CI/CD integration and documentation: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

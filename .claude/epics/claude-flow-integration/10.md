# Task 10: Docker Workflow - Configure containerized execution environment

## Description

Configure a comprehensive Docker-based development and execution environment for the Claude Flow integration. This includes containerized services, development workflows, and production-ready deployment configurations that ensure consistent execution across all environments while maintaining security and performance standards.

The Docker workflow will provide isolated, reproducible environments for all components of the Claude Flow system, including the orchestrator, agents, databases, and supporting services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-service Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Development environment with hot-reload capabilities
- [ ] Production-ready container images with minimal attack surface
- [ ] MongoDB containerized with proper data persistence
- [ ] Prisma Client integration in containerized environment
- [ ] Network isolation and security configurations
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring for all services
- [ ] Volume management for persistent data and logs
- [ ] Container orchestration for scaling capabilities
- [ ] Testing environment with automated test execution

## Technical Details

### Core Components

1. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Multi-service orchestration
   - Environment-specific overrides (dev, test, prod)
   - Network isolation and communication
   - Volume management and data persistence

2. **Service Containers**
   - Claude Flow orchestrator service
   - MongoDB database with replica set support
   - Prisma Client service for database UI
   - Redis for caching and session management
   - Nginx for reverse proxy and load balancing

3. **Development Environment**
   - Hot-reload capabilities for rapid development
   - Debugging support with proper port exposure
   - Development tools and utilities
   - IDE integration and debugging setup

4. **Production Configuration**
   - Multi-stage builds for optimized images
   - Security hardening and minimal base images
   - Resource limits and constraints
   - Health checks and restart policies

```

### Key Features

- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinated startup and shutdown of all services
- **Data Persistence**: Proper volume management for databases and logs
- **Security**: Network isolation, secrets management, and security scanning
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities with load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics collection, and log aggregation

### Container Services

1. **Orchestrator Service**
   - Python-based application container
   - Claude Flow orchestrator and agent management
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates

2. **MongoDB Service**
   - MongoDB 7.x with replica set configuration
   - Data persistence with proper backup strategies
   - Connection pooling and performance optimization
   - Security configurations and authentication

3. **Prisma Service**
   - Prisma Client with database introspection
   - GraphQL API for database operations
   - Admin interface for database management
   - Migration and seeding capabilities

4. **Redis Service**
   - Caching layer for session management
   - Task queue support with Redis Streams
   - Pub/sub messaging for real-time features
   - Persistence configuration for reliability

### Development Workflow

- **Hot Reload**: Code changes automatically reflected in containers
- **Debug Support**: Remote debugging capabilities with IDE integration
- **Test Execution**: Automated testing within containerized environments
- **Database Seeding**: Automated database setup with sample data

## Dependencies

None - This task can run in parallel with all other tasks as it provides the foundational infrastructure.

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Small (S)
**Estimated Hours**: 8 hours

### Breakdown:
- Docker Compose configuration: 3 hours
- Individual service Dockerfiles: 2 hours
- Development workflow setup: 1 hour
- Production optimization: 1 hour

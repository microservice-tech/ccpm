# Task: Create merge strategies (skip, backup, overwrite)

## Description
Implement the three core merge strategies for handling file conflicts during installation: skip (preserve existing), backup (save original and install new), and overwrite (replace existing). Each strategy should be configurable and provide clear feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement 'skip' strategy to preserve existing files
- [ ] Implement 'backup' strategy to create timestamped backups before overwriting
- [ ] Implement 'overwrite' strategy to replace files directly
- [ ] Support per-file strategy specification via interactive prompts
- [ ] Create backup directory structure with clear naming conventions
- [ ] Provide detailed logging of all merge actions taken
- [ ] Support dry-run mode to preview merge actions without execution

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create modular functions for each merge strategy
- Key files affected: install/ccpm.sh (add merge strategy functions)
- Backup naming convention: original.bak.{timestamp}
- Interactive prompts for conflict resolution when strategy not specified
- Comprehensive logging of all file operations for audit trail

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 21: File scanning must be completed to identify conflicts
- [ ] Standard Unix utilities (cp, mv, mkdir) available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented for all three merge strategies
- [ ] Tests written and passing for each strategy scenario
- [ ] Documentation updated with strategy descriptions and examples
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Interactive mode tested and validated

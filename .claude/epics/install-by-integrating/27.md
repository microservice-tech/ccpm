# Task: Add validation command to verify successful integration

## Description
Create a validation command or script that users can run to verify their CCPM installation is working correctly. This should check all aspects of the installation including package manager integration, PATH configuration, and core functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validation command checks package manager installation
- [ ] Verifies PATH configuration is correct
- [ ] Tests core CCPM functionality
- [ ] Provides clear success/failure feedback
- [ ] Includes diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- [ ] Works on both Unix and Windows platforms
- [ ] Can be run as part of installation process or standalone

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create standalone validation script callable via `ccpm --validate` or similar
- Key files affected:
  - New validation script/module
  - Integration with main CCPM CLI
  - Updates to installation scripts to optionally run validation
- Validation checks to include:
  - Package manager accessibility
  - CCPM binary location and permissions
  - Shell integration status
  - Core command functionality
  - Configuration file integrity

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 25 completed (need working implementation to validate)
- [ ] Understanding of all installation components
- [ ] Access to test environments for validation testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Validation command implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive checks for all installation components
- [ ] Clear user feedback and diagnostic information
- [ ] Integration with main CLI
- [ ] Tests written for validation functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with validation instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed

# Task: Port implementation to Windows (PowerShell/Batch)

## Description
Port the complete bash-based installation logic to Windows PowerShell/Batch scripts to ensure cross-platform compatibility. This includes replicating all integration functionality, package manager detection, and error handling from the Unix implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] install/ccpm.bat successfully installs on Windows systems
- [ ] All package manager detection logic ported (Chocolatey, Scoop, winget)
- [ ] Error handling and validation equivalent to bash version
- [ ] Integration with existing PATH and shell configuration
- [ ] Maintains same command-line interface and options
- [ ] Proper handling of Windows-specific paths and conventions

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Complete rewrite of install/ccpm.bat using PowerShell core logic
- Key files affected:
  - install/ccpm.bat (primary implementation)
  - Potentially new PowerShell helper scripts if needed
- Port all functionality from bash version including:
  - Package manager detection and installation
  - PATH manipulation
  - Shell integration (PowerShell, Command Prompt)
  - Error handling and user feedback

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 23 must be completed (need complete bash implementation as reference)
- [ ] Windows testing environment available
- [ ] PowerShell execution policy considerations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested on Windows
- [ ] All bash functionality replicated in Windows version
- [ ] Integration tests pass on Windows
- [ ] Error handling equivalent to Unix version
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated for Windows-specific considerations

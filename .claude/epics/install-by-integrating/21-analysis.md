# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #21

## Overview
Implement comprehensive file scanning and conflict detection functionality in the ccpm.sh script. This involves creating functions for directory traversal, file comparison, conflict categorization, and structured output generation.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Scanning Engine
**Scope**: Directory traversal and file discovery logic
**Files**:
- `install/ccpm.sh` - Add scanning functions (scan_directory, find_files, apply_ignore_patterns)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: none
**Work Items**:
- Implement recursive directory scanner using find
- Add ignore pattern support (.gitignore style)
- Create file listing and categorization logic
- Handle symlinks and special files safely

### Stream B: Conflict Detection System
**Scope**: File comparison and conflict identification
**Files**:
- `install/ccpm.sh` - Add conflict detection functions (detect_conflicts, compare_files, categorize_conflicts)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: none
**Work Items**:
- Implement file comparison using diff
- Create conflict categorization (config vs code vs docs)
- Build conflict severity assessment
- Generate conflict resolution recommendations

### Stream C: Output Formatting & Testing
**Scope**: Structured output generation and comprehensive testing
**Files**:
- `install/ccpm.sh` - Add output formatting functions (generate_report, format_json_output)
- `install/test_scanning.sh` - New test file for validation
**Agent Type**: fullstack-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B complete their core functions
**Estimated Hours**: 1
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (for integration)
**Work Items**:
- Create JSON output formatter
- Build human-readable conflict report
- Write comprehensive test suite
- Performance testing on large directories

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
The main coordination point is `install/ccpm.sh`:
- Stream A adds scanning functions in the middle section
- Stream B adds conflict detection functions after scanning
- Stream C adds output functions at the end
- Use clear function naming to avoid conflicts

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core scanning functions (Stream A) can be tested independently
2. Conflict detection (Stream B) can be developed with mock data initially
3. Integration and output (Stream C) requires both A & B to be functional

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different function sets within the same file
- **Mitigation**: Clear function naming conventions and defined sections in the script
- **Coordination**: Regular commits with descriptive messages

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Parallel start with convergence

1. Launch Streams A & B simultaneously (both can work independently)
2. Each stream develops and tests their functions in isolation
3. When both complete core functionality (~2.5 hours), launch Stream C
4. Stream C integrates the functions and adds output formatting

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 2.5 hours
- Total work: 4 hours
- Efficiency gain: 37.5%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours

## Implementation Notes

### Stream A Focus Areas:
- Efficient directory traversal (handle large repos)
- Proper ignore pattern matching (gitignore syntax)
- Edge cases: symlinks, hidden files, permissions

### Stream B Focus Areas:
- Smart conflict detection (not just file existence)
- Content-aware comparison (detect meaningful changes)
- Categorization logic (config files need different handling)

### Stream C Focus Areas:
- Clear, actionable output format
- Both human and machine-readable formats
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance benchmarks

## Testing Strategy

Each stream should include:
1. Unit tests for individual functions
2. Integration tests for the complete workflow
3. Edge case testing (empty dirs, large files, deep nesting)
4. Performance testing with realistic directory structures

## Notes
- The scanning logic should be reusable for future features (manifest generation, rollback)
- Consider memory efficiency for large directory structures
- Output format should support piping to other tools
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing script structure

# Task: Add manifest generation and rollback capability

## Description
Create a comprehensive manifest system that tracks all installation changes and provides rollback capability. The manifest will record all file operations, backups, and changes made during installation to enable safe reversal of the integration process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generate .ccpm-manifest.json file tracking all installation actions
- [ ] Record file operations (created, modified, backed up) with timestamps
- [ ] Include checksums for integrity verification
- [ ] Implement rollback command to reverse installation changes
- [ ] Support partial rollback of specific files or operations
- [ ] Validate manifest integrity before rollback operations
- [ ] Provide clear rollback status and progress reporting

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: JSON manifest with structured operation logging
- Key files affected: install/ccpm.sh (add manifest generation and rollback functions)
- Manifest location: target directory/.ccpm-manifest.json
- Include operation type, file paths, checksums, and timestamps
- Rollback logic to restore backups and remove installed files

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 22: Merge strategies must be implemented to track operations
- [ ] JSON parsing utilities (jq) or manual JSON handling in bash

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented for manifest generation and rollback
- [ ] Tests written and passing for manifest creation and rollback scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with manifest format and rollback procedures
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] End-to-end rollback functionality validated

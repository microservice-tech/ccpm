# Task: Create integration tests for various scenarios

## Description
Develop comprehensive integration tests that validate the installation process across different platforms, package managers, and system configurations. Tests should cover both Unix and Windows environments with various edge cases and failure scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test suite covers Unix (bash) and Windows (PowerShell/Batch) installations
- [ ] Tests validate all supported package managers on each platform
- [ ] Edge case testing (missing dependencies, permission issues, existing installations)
- [ ] Automated test runner that can execute on CI/CD
- [ ] Test cleanup and environment reset functionality
- [ ] Performance testing for installation speed
- [ ] Integration with existing test infrastructure

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create comprehensive test suite using appropriate testing framework
- Key files affected:
  - New test files in test/integration/ directory
  - CI/CD configuration updates
  - Test utilities and helpers
- Test scenarios to cover:
  - Fresh system installations
  - Upgrade scenarios
  - Multiple package manager environments
  - Different shell configurations
  - Permission and access issues
  - Network connectivity problems

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 24 completed (need Windows implementation to test)
- [ ] Testing environments for both Unix and Windows
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline access for automated testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite implemented
- [ ] Tests pass on both Unix and Windows platforms
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test documentation and usage instructions
- [ ] Code coverage meets project standards
- [ ] Code reviewed

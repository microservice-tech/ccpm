# Task: Implement file scanning and conflict detection logic

## Description
Create comprehensive file scanning and conflict detection functionality to identify existing files that would be affected by the installation and determine the appropriate merge strategy for each conflict.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scan target directory for existing files that conflict with installation
- [ ] Generate detailed conflict report showing file differences
- [ ] Identify file types and categorize conflicts (config, code, documentation)
- [ ] Create conflict resolution recommendations based on file analysis
- [ ] Support recursive directory scanning with ignore patterns
- [ ] Generate structured output for downstream processing

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create bash functions for directory traversal and file comparison
- Key files affected: install/ccpm.sh (add scanning functions)
- Use find, diff, and file type detection utilities
- Create conflict detection matrix comparing source vs target
- Generate JSON or structured output for conflict resolution

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 20: Argument parsing must be completed first
- [ ] Access to diff, find, and file utilities in target environment

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented for comprehensive file scanning
- [ ] Tests written and passing for conflict detection scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with scanning behavior
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Performance validated on large directory structures

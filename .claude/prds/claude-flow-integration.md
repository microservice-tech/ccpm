# PRD: Claude Flow Integration

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of Claude Flow's hive-mind capabilities into the CCPM (Claude Code Project Management) system to enable autonomous, intelligent implementation of GitHub issues. The system will leverage specialized AI agent personas working collaboratively to transform GitHub issues into fully implemented, tested, and documented features with minimal human intervention. A systemd service will continuously monitor GitHub issues and orchestrate the hive-mind to handle implementation, testing, and PR creation automatically.

## Problem Statement

Current development workflows require significant manual intervention for issue implementation, even with AI assistance. Developers must:
- Manually trigger AI agents for each task
- Coordinate between different tools and environments
- Manage state between different implementation phases
- Ensure consistent quality and testing standards
- Handle context switching between multiple issues

This creates bottlenecks in development velocity and requires constant human oversight, limiting the potential of AI-assisted development.

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: Project Manager
**As a** Project Manager  
**I want** to create GitHub issues that are automatically implemented by AI agents  
**So that** I can focus on product strategy rather than implementation coordination  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can create issues with clear requirements
- Receives automated updates on implementation progress
- Gets notified when PRs are ready for review
- Can track hive-mind activity through issue comments

### Secondary Persona: Developer
**As a** Developer  
**I want** the hive-mind to handle routine implementation tasks  
**So that** I can focus on architecture and complex problem-solving  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Systemd service runs reliably on local machine
- Can monitor hive-mind activity in real-time
- Can intervene when necessary
- Receives quality code with proper testing

### Tertiary Persona: Hive-Mind Orchestrator
**As the** Hive-Mind Orchestrator  
**I need** to coordinate specialized agents  
**So that** issues are implemented efficiently and correctly  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatically assigns appropriate agent personas
- Manages state between implementation phases
- Ensures all quality gates are met
- Creates comprehensive documentation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Hive-Mind Capabilities
1. **Issue Monitoring & Selection**
   - Poll GitHub issues at configurable intervals (default: 5 minutes)
   - Identify issues with "ready-for-implementation" label
   - Priority queue based on issue labels and milestones
   - Skip issues already being processed

2. **Agent Persona Management**
   - Workflow Architect: Decomposes issues into implementation tasks
   - Backend Specialist: Handles MongoDB/Prisma implementations
   - Frontend Specialist: Manages UI components and interactions
   - Testing Specialist: Creates Playwright/unit tests
   - DevOps Specialist: Manages Docker configurations
   - Documentation Specialist: Updates docs and comments

3. **State Management System**
   - Persistent state storage for ongoing implementations
   - Recovery mechanism for interrupted workflows
   - Progress tracking per issue
   - Context preservation between agent handoffs

4. **Implementation Workflow**
   - Parse issue requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Generate implementation plan with task breakdown
   - Execute tasks using appropriate agent personas
   - Run tests in Docker containers
   - Create PR with implementation summary
   - Update issue with progress and completion status

5. **Claude Flow MCP Integration**
   - Install and configure all required MCPs
   - Playwright for UI testing automation
   - Puppeteer for browser automation tasks
   - MongoDB connector for database operations
   - Prisma tools for ORM management
   - Docker integration for containerized development

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Issue processing initiation within 30 seconds of detection
- Support parallel processing of up to 3 issues simultaneously
- Complete simple issues (< 5 tasks) within 30 minutes
- Complex issues (> 5 tasks) within 2 hours

#### Security
- Secure storage of GitHub authentication tokens
- Respect repository access permissions
- No exposure of sensitive data in logs or comments
- Secure handling of private repository access

#### Reliability
- Automatic recovery from agent failures
- Graceful handling of API rate limits
- Rollback capability for failed implementations
- Comprehensive error logging and alerting

#### Scalability
- Support for multiple repositories
- Configurable resource limits per hive-mind instance
- Queue management for high issue volumes
- Distributed processing capability (future)

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics
- **Automation Rate**: 80% of labeled issues implemented without human intervention
- **Quality Score**: 90% of PRs pass initial review without major changes
- **Test Coverage**: All implementations include >90% test coverage
- **Time to Implementation**: 75% reduction in issue-to-PR time

### Secondary Metrics
- **Issue Update Frequency**: Progress updates every 10 minutes during implementation
- **PR Completeness**: 100% of PRs include tests, documentation, and implementation notes
- **Service Uptime**: 99% availability during business hours
- **Error Recovery Rate**: 95% of failures recovered automatically

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Requires authenticated GitHub CLI access
- Limited by GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour)
- Requires local development environment with Docker
- Systemd service requires Linux/macOS environment
- Claude API usage limits apply

### Assumptions
- Issues are well-defined with clear acceptance criteria
- Development environment has necessary tools installed
- GitHub repository follows standard conventions
- Private repositories are accessible via authenticated gh CLI
- Network connectivity is stable and reliable

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly NOT included in this phase:
- Windows service implementation (systemd alternative)
- Multi-cloud deployment orchestration
- Direct production deployment (requires human approval)
- Database migration execution (requires human review)
- Breaking API changes (requires architectural review)
- Security vulnerability patches (requires security team review)
- Cost optimization for cloud resources
- Custom LLM training or fine-tuning
- Cross-repository dependency management
- Real-time collaborative editing with humans
